## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
If I were hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure, I would implement Scrum for the school. It helps their IT team to enhance productivity by organizing work into smaller, manageable tasks that can be completed within short cycles, called sprints. This approach will keep the team to stay focused with quick response and adaptation towards changes and ensure steady progress.
 
Scrum also promotes daily communication through short meetings, where team members update each other and address any issues. This helps catch problems early and keeps everyone aligned. After each sprint, the team reflects on what went well and what could be improved, fostering continuous improvement.

By giving the team ownership of their work and encouraging collaboration, Scrum boosts motivation and leads to more innovative solutions. Its flexibility is ideal for a startup environment, where priorities can shift quickly. The IT team can focus on delivering the most critical features first, ensuring the school's infrastructure evolves to meet its needs.
Overall, Scrum helps the IT team work more efficiently, communicate effectively, and continuously improve, leading to faster and better project delivery.

Scenario 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
1.	As a book borrower (full-time student), I want to search for books by title, author, or subject, so that I can quickly find the books I need for my studies.
2.	As a book borrower (part-time student), I want to leave reviews and ratings for books I've read, so that I can share my opinions and help others choose their next read.
3.	As a librarian, I want to manage the inventory of books, including adding new books and updating book details, so that the catalogue is always accurate and up to date.
4.	As a backend developer, I want to implement a secure user authentication system, so that only registered users can borrow books and access their borrowing history.
5.	As a frontend developer, I want to create a user-friendly interface for browsing and borrowing books, so that users can easily navigate the website and complete their tasks.
6.	As a book borrower (part-time student), I want to see the due dates of my borrowed books and receive reminders, so that I can return books on time and avoid late fees.
7.	As a librarian, I want to generate reports on book borrowing trends, so that I can make informed decisions about which books to purchase or discard.
8.	As a book borrower (working adult), I want to reserve books online, so that I can ensure the books I need are available for pickup when I visit the library.
9.	As a system administrator, I want to manage user roles and permissions, so that different users have access to the features they need while maintaining security.
10.	As a full stack developer, I want to integrate a notification system that alerts users about due dates and reserved books, so that they stay informed about their borrowing status.
